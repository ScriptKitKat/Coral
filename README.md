# Inspiration
Due to climate change, coral algae (which give corals their color) is stressed by the heat and causes coral bleaching. Corals are vital for ocean communities, so by identifying the problem early, there can be early prevention.

# What it does
Detects signs of coral bleaching from images.

# How it's built it
ML model with kaggle dataset & Google Collab (trained with pytorch)
Blood, sweat, and tears (Html, Javascript, css, and flask)
# Challenges ran into
Training the ML model was particulary challenging since I trained the model on images, so it took a long time for the model to iterate over the dataset. Additionally, the model would time out occasionally so I had to implement checkpoints for the ML model

# What's next for CoralGuard
Implementation in an actual underwater camera
